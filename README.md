# Robot-3-DOF-Reinforcement-learning-control

> **Warning:** Project is being migrated to individual repository. Stay tuned for updates.

RL control of a 3-DOF robot using stable baselines to achieve certain positions.

The goal of this project is to be able to control a robot with 3-DOF and then expand to a UR3e-like robot with 6-DOF, as shown in the image below, to achieve specific positions based solely on the final effector position, using reinforcement learning (RL) for control.

## 3-DOF Robot

I designed an environment to simulate the dynamics of a 3-DOF robot and implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) to achieve the required control.

### Key Features
- **Custom Simulation Environment**: Simulates the dynamics of a 3-DOF robot.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: Uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training.
- **End Effector Control**: Focused on achieving target positions based solely on end effector dynamics.

### Results
- The RL agent successfully learns to control the 3-DOF robot, achieving precise end effector positioning after training.

### Future Work
- SImulate a 6-DOF robot
- Extend the environment to include obstacles for collision avoidance.
- Scale the implementation to control robots with higher degrees of freedom.
- Compare PPO with other RL algorithms like DDPG or SAC.
